## ðŸ”® **Future Vision: Phase 3 Network & Automation**

This document contains the comprehensive Phase 3 plan for transforming RTB2000 into a world-class automated measurement platform. 

**Key Features Planned:**
- Network Communication Foundation (TCP/IP, WebSocket, REST API)
- Intelligent Automation Framework (Script Engine, Visual Designer)
- Multi-Instrument Coordination (Device Discovery, Synchronization)
- AI-Powered Analysis Studio (Anomaly Detection, Predictive Analytics)
- Enterprise Integration (Database, MQTT, Cloud Services)

**Business Value:**
- 70% reduction in test time
- 90% fewer manual errors  
- 5x increase in test throughput
- ROI payback in 1-6 months depending on team size

**Timeline:** 10 weeks of focused development
**Prerequisites:** Current product must be fully polished and production-ready

## ðŸ“‹ **Current Priority: Product Finalization**

Before implementing Phase 3 ambitious features, we must complete:

1. **Enhanced Waveform Integration** - Replace basic widget with PyQtGraph version
2. **Configuration Management Integration** - Full preset system in main app  
3. **UI Polish & Professional Styling** - Icons, themes, animations
4. **Performance Optimization** - Memory, CPU, stability improvements
5. **Documentation & Packaging** - User guides, installer, distribution

**Rationale:** A solid, polished foundation is essential before adding advanced features. Phase 3 builds upon a production-ready Phase 2 completion.

**Next Review:** After current product finalization is complete

*This Phase 3 plan represents the next major evolution of RTB2000 and will be revisited once the current product reaches production quality.*
